        <h2>hi there</h2>
        Once upon time a man was walking in forest and he happened to see an exotic bird being very charmed by it and wanting to have it as a pet. He tiptoed towards it from behind and caught it to his utter surprise the bird started talking and it said to him "please release me. In return I will give you three gems. Three valuable piece of advice that can transform your life." I will give you the first one only when you let me go. The second one when I fly up to that branch and third one when I fly up high to the very top of this tree. The man instantly agreed and let the bird go. As soon as it was freed the bird started flying up as it said here's the first gem my first piece of advice....

1) Do not torture, torment and burden yourself with excessive regret for your past mistakes as the man pondered over what he had just heard. The bird flew up sat on a branch and spoke back and the second one is

2) Do not believe anything that goes against common sense unless you have first hand proof.

The man then saw the bird fly to the very top of the crown of the tree. It's started laughing and said to the man you are a fool within my body are two huge jewels if you would have kept me and killed me instead of letting me go you would have been the master of these precious jewels and would have become instantly Rich. "oh my god"..the man exclaimed how could I have been so stupid..!..i never be able to forget this foolishness for rest of my life. Oh Bird can you at least give me your last the third piece of advice may be that will have the potential to pacify me. The bird replied I was just testing you. You are asking me for further advice but did you even realize that you have already disregard the eriler two piece of advice I gave you first I told you not to torment yourself with excessive regret for past mistakes and yet you just tormented yourself with regret for letting me go and second I told you not to believe in things that against common sense unless there is first hand proof and you disregard that advice well for some reason believing that there could be two huge jewels inside a tiny bird like me but since you have asked me now for third piece of advice here it is

3) If you are not applying what you already know there is no point being so intent on gaining what you do not know.

Saying so the bird flew away....And As the man received these 3 jewels that would positively change his life to come.

We all make mistakes. Don't be too harsh to yourself and keep punishing yourself and tormenting yourself for what has already been done and can't be done but learn your lesson and move on be sharp, be shrewd, don't evaluated things by face value. Use your reason discretion before you accepting /trusting something or someone and lastly. If you don't digest what you have received by applying it. you not ready for more. Life gives you more only when you use what you have rightly. knowledge and make-up are very similar both do well only when applied it. Make-up changes looks and knowledge changes life.....
